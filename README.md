# Movie-Recommendation
People spend a lot of time on their hobbies (reading,
writing, dancing, sports or even socializing). This research is
designed to examine the correlation between these interests and
the genre of movies preferred. Sometimes fears also affect the
movie enjoyed. The aim of this project is to recommend a movie
genre to a user after considering a few attributes like hobbies
and fears.
The users can be clustered based on their likes and dislikes. The
similarity between the users in a particular cluster can be used
to determine the movie genres for a new user. Agglomerative
Kmodes was used for clustering and collaborative filtering was
used to calculate similarity and recommend genres.
The accuracy of this recommendation system was calculated
using K-fold cross validation
